  <h1>Allie</h1>
  <p>Allie was created as part of my bachelorthesis on increasing accessibility during development.</p>
  <p>This framework will guide you by means of strict CSS selectors, CSS files that validate your code and a series of Gulp tasks towards following the principles of universal design.</p>
  <p>Special thanks to Heydon Pickering and Elad Shechter for writing the used CSS files to validate html.</p>
  <p>This is NOT a replacement of accessibility tests, nor is it a fully grown CSS framework! <br>
  You are very much invited to use and expand this basis to fit your own needs.</p>
  <p>Full documentation is included within.</p>
  <p>Kind regards,<br>
