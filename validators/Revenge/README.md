## REVENGE.CSS

The premise of `revenge.css` is simple: A *CSS bookmarklet* that uses selectors to find bad markup, displaying ugly pink error messages in *comic sans serif* wherever you write bad HTML. If you activate the bookmarklet and the page gets lots of pink blotches, the author has included at least one of the following:

* Misplaced &lt;div&gt;s
* Deprecated elements
* Malformed hyperlinks
* Inaccessible forms
* Empty elements
* Inaccessible images
* Missing ARIA landmarks
* Badly authored sectioning elements
* Erroneous lists
* Obsolete attributes

## Try the bookmarklet

GitHub won't let me use javascript in my README. Pretty sensible. Go to the new <a href="http://heydonworks.com/revenge_css_bookmarklet/">hot pink, skull-festooned demo page</a>.
